Farmers in Telangana, like those in many regions of India, face a variety of challenges. Here are some of the key problems they encounter:

Water Scarcity: Despite the presence of major rivers, water scarcity is a significant issue due to irregular monsoon patterns, over-extraction of groundwater, and inefficient irrigation practices.
Dependence on Monsoon: The agriculture sector heavily relies on the monsoon rains, leading to uncertainty in crop yields. Erratic rainfall can result in droughts or floods, impacting productivity.
Soil Degradation: Continuous cultivation without adequate soil management practices has led to soil degradation, affecting fertility and productivity.
Pest and Disease Management: Farmers often struggle with pest infestations and crop diseases, which can lead to significant losses if not managed effectively.
Market Access and Pricing: Farmers frequently face challenges in accessing markets for their produce. Fluctuating prices and lack of direct market access can lead to financial instability.
